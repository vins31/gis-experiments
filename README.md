### Altitude roads

When you use Google Maps or opencyclemap to plan a trip in a plain, **everything looks flat**, even if you have 100m elevation changes on your way. If there is a small hill or a valley you may not see it well because the **map is so overloaded** that you cannot focus on the coutour lines.

The solution would be to have a map with **custom elevation information optimized for you are area**.
In a glimpse, you would be able to see:

* small elevation changes, small hills, small valleys
* the steepest roads to avoid
* the minimal climb longuest path from home

This Python notebook will enable you to generate an elevation map optimized for your area.
